Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): It is a finite directed graph with no directed cycles. That is, it consists of finitely many vertices and edges, with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that there is no way to start at any vertex v and follow a consistently-directed sequence of edges that eventually loops back to v again.

Consistent sub-Directed Acyclic Graphs: It is defiend as a sub-DAG in which parent of each node is included (considering root doesn't have a parent).
